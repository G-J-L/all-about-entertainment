            <p class="md:text-3xl text-xl font-bold">Is the VFX Industry Facing its Final Cut?</p>
            <p class="md:text-xl text-base pt-1">By Enrico Buan Jr.</p>

            <div class="mt-10 mb-20 md:text-base text-sm">
                <p>The VFX industry is well known for being the best in terms of making amazing media editing effects and the quality of movies we watch today. They have a great reputation for being known for making fictional explosions and environments. The strength of the VFX is what supports the making of the movies we know and love, and that is why it is essential to have them in the studio because of their creative imagination to move fiction from reality.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The problem that is occurring in the state of the VFX industry is that in the year after the pandemic, they have lost the will to make good quality VFX effects for the upcoming great movies ahead of 2020-2024. The recent changes are that it's the issue of the people who work in the VFX industry who lost their craft for making the quality they have wanted for specific movies and animations. They struggle with profit-making and inflation issues due to their living conditions. They cannot make their job a motivation to create beautiful effects of what the VFX industry can show.</p>
                <br>
                <p>What happens to these workers of visual artists is that the decline of their jobs after the pandemic has increased and the pressure in the state of the economy has held them considerably. And in the near future, the VFX industry has to worry about being taken over by AI, which each year they slowly get to human quality. These are the main issues that have taken over the many jobs that use VFX studios as their profession, and that is why it is a crisis when the future movies people will watch will end up in poor quality as compared to the old movies. Old movies that prove the efforts of VFX are The Avengers made by Marvel Studios, Pirates of the Caribbean made by Walt Disney, and Interstellar that was directed by Christopher Nolan. This era of movies is the proof of knowing about what happened to the state of the VFX industry, as the noticeable issue that is well known is Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, made by Marvel Studios.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The best issue that defines the state of VFX is the Marvel Studio, Disney, and the DC Studio. It is because, due to the comparisons of VFX quality for each latest movie, there is a greatly noticeable effect that has degraded or been made poorly in most scenes in the state of the cinema industry. This also happens on subscription-based services, for example, Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime, as VFX effects are being made in lower quality as compared to the movies we know and love.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To conclude, the state of the VFX industry as of 2024 has been in an immense struggle as the recent job declines, the addition of AI, and lastly, the economic struggle. The effort of the VFX artist had been demotivated through these struggles they had to encounter after the pandemic effect and the rise of inflation. This shows how future movies will not have the same quality as the previous successors of the movies where the artists have shown effort and passion.</p>
