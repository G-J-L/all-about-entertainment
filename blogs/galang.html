            <p class="md:text-xl text-base pt-1">By Joaquin Galang</p>

            <div class="mt-10 mb-20 md:text-base text-sm">
                <p>On a surface level, Dungeons & Dragons may seem like a niche and nerdy hobby, but it can have an unexpected amount of psychological, social, and cognitive benefits. Dungeons & Dragons is a tabletop roleplaying game set in a world of fantasy. It is a collaborative story-telling experience where a group of friends create fictional characters and go on adventures prepared by the dungeon master. In recent years, the game’s popularity has been skyrocketing. This can be attributed to various media that highlight the game, such as the hit Netflix series Stranger Things and The Big Bang Theory. Additionally, Wizards of the Coast partnered with Larian Studios to develop and release Baldur’s Gate 3. The third installment of the Baldur’s Gate video game franchise based on Dungeons & Dragons. Furthermore, a number of celebrities including Vin Diesel, Terry Crews, and Stephen Colbert have ventured into the make-believe world. The game got so popular, in fact, that in 2023, Paramount Pictures released a D&D movie titled Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves which got a rotten tomato score of 91%.</p>
                <br>
                <p>It goes without saying that the success of Dungeons & Dragons speaks for itself. That being said, as all eyes narrow on the tabletop roleplaying game, experts are beginning to unearth psychological benefits that come with playing. A study conducted by researchers at University College Cork suggests that playing Dungeons & Dragons can have a positive impact on an individual’s mental health. The participants of the study strongly focused on the feeling of escapism, and how it helped them gain a sense of control in-game. The table became an environment where they could comfortably explore problems and practice skills outside of the real world. It was a safe space where they could be vulnerable and express themselves creatively without fear of judgment.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Furthermore, the collaborative nature of Dungeons & Dragons fosters and improves communication. This idea is validated by Aubrie Adams, a doctoral student from the University of California, Santa Barbara. In her study titled, Needs met through role-playing games: A fantasy theme analysis of Dungeons & Dragons, her analysis identified that a player’s social needs were fulfilled through group communication when tackling in-game scenarios that involve democracy, friendship, extraordinary experiences, and ethics.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Aside from improving mental health and social skills, Phillip Harrity, a Dungeons & Dragons camp instructor at Point Park University testifies that playing may also sharpen cognitive and problem solving skills. In an article, he said “D&D is a game that has a ton of educational benefits. At its core, the game can teach you teamwork, math, physics, problem-solving and quick decision-making.” The flexible game mechanics gives players the liberty to think outside of the box and come up with their own solutions to problems they may face instead of having to choose between two or three predetermined choices like in most modern roleplay based video games.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Everyday, more experts and curious onlookers are recognizing the potential of this tabletop roleplaying game. Not just as an enjoyable and collaborative past-time activity, but also as a powerful therapeutic tool used to nurture an individual’s communication and problem solving skills.</p>
