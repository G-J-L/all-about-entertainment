# all-about-entertainment
 The following project is a blog website developed as part of a group activity for our Technical Writing subject. You can visit the website by navigating to the following URL: [https://all-about-entertainment.pages.dev/](https://all-about-entertainment.pages.dev/). We were instructed to write blog articles on a topic of our choosing and compile all of our articles into blog website of our making. Collectively, we decided to have our topics revolve around the entertainment industry. More information about the group members are available in the **About Us** section of the page.
